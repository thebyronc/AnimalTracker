### Behavior Driven Specifications
As a userâ€¦
- I want to log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.
- I want to view a list of animals I have logged.
- I want options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (2 years of age and older).
- I want to click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers.

### Future Additions
- Add picture loading and Display
- Link to zoo webcam api to see a live feed of Animal
- Add custom SASS styling with corresponding Gulp tasks to compile.
- Display of the total number of caretakers needed in a day.
- Add a property that records when each animal was admitted. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.
- Expand the application to differentiate between animals' species. Group the animals into those categories. Then include a component to display the total needed caretakers for whichever species the user selects.
- Add a new master component to average the total age for each species.
- Show animals based on diet type. Then, show all animals who eat meat (carnivores AND omnivores)
