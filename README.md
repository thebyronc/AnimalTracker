### Behavior Driven Specifications
As a userâ€¦
- I want to log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.
- I want to view a list of animals I have logged.
- I want options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (2 years of age and older).
- I want to click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers.
